# Story 1.7: Deployment Pipeline Setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated deployment pipelines for staging and production environments,
**so that** I can deploy IdeaStash reliably with proper CI/CD workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
2. Vercel integration for automatic frontend deployments
3. Staging environment for pre-production testing
4. Production environment with proper security and monitoring
5. Environment variable management across all stages
6. Health check endpoints for deployment verification
7. Rollback capability for failed deployments

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflows (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for test automation
  - [ ] Create .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml for staging deployments
  - [ ] Create .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml for production
  - [ ] Configure workflow triggers (PR, main branch push)
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Connect GitHub repository to Vercel project
  - [ ] Configure build settings (pnpm, Next.js 14+)
  - [ ] Set up automatic deployments for main branch
  - [ ] Configure preview deployments for pull requests
- [ ] Set up staging environment (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create staging.ideastash.com subdomain
  - [ ] Configure staging-specific environment variables
  - [ ] Set up separate Supabase staging project
  - [ ] Configure staging Clerk application
- [ ] Configure production environment (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Set up production domain (ideastash.com)
  - [ ] Configure production environment variables
  - [ ] Set up production Supabase project with backups
  - [ ] Configure production Clerk application with custom domain
- [ ] Implement environment variable management (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Set up Vercel environment variables for all environments
  - [ ] Configure GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows
  - [ ] Document required environment variables
  - [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration validation
- [ ] Create health check endpoints (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Enhance /api/health endpoint with detailed system status
  - [ ] Add database connectivity check
  - [ ] Add external service status checks (Clerk, Supabase)
  - [ ] Configure health check monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Set up rollback capabilities (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Configure Vercel deployment protection for production
  - [ ] Set up deployment approval workflow for critical changes
  - [ ] Document rollback procedures for emergencies
  - [ ] Test rollback process with staging environment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Requires all previous stories (1.1-1.6) completion for full application functionality to deploy.

### Deployment Architecture
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
**Platform Strategy:**
- **Frontend**: Vercel Edge Network with automatic deployments
- **Backend API**: Next.js API routes deployed with frontend
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with automatic backups
- **Authentication**: Clerk with custom domain configuration

**Environment Structure:**
- Development: http://localhost:3000
- Staging: https://staging.ideastash.com
- Production: https://ideastash.com

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
1. **CI Pipeline (ci.yml):**
   - Install dependencies with pnpm
   - Run TypeScript compilation checks
   - Execute unit and integration tests
   - Run ESLint and Prettier checks
   - Build Next.js application

2. **Staging Deploy (deploy-staging.yml):**
   - Trigger on main branch push
   - Run full CI pipeline
   - Deploy to Vercel staging environment
   - Run health checks post-deployment

3. **Production Deploy (deploy-production.yml):**
   - Trigger on release tag creation
   - Require manual approval
   - Deploy to Vercel production
   - Run comprehensive health checks

### Environment Variables
[Source: stories/1.1.project-setup.md, 1.2.database-setup.md, 1.3.clerk-auth.md]
**Required Environment Variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Application URL for each environment
- `DATABASE_URL` - Supabase PostgreSQL connection
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk public key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk server-side secret

### Health Check Implementation
[Source: stories/1.1.project-setup.md]
Enhanced health check response format:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-25T10:00:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "database": "connected",
    "authentication": "operational",
    "api": "responding"
  }
}
```

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- CI/CD workflows: `.github/workflows/` directory
- Vercel configuration: `vercel.json` for deployment settings
- Environment templates: `.env.local.example` with all required vars

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md]
- Environment variables stored securely in Vercel/GitHub
- Production deployment requires manual approval
- Staging environment uses separate authentication/database
- Health checks don't expose sensitive information

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Deployment tests: Verify health checks pass post-deployment
- Environment tests: Test configuration for each environment
- Integration tests: Full application flow in staging
- Performance tests: Load testing on staging before production
