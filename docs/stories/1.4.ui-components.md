# Story 1.4: Basic UI Components Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a set of reusable UI components following the IdeaStash design system,
**so that** I can build consistent user interfaces efficiently across the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Base UI components (Button, Input, Modal, Spinner) implemented with Tailwind CSS
2. Layout components (Header, Navigation, Layout wrapper) created
3. TypeScript interfaces and props validation for all components
4. IdeaStash color palette and design tokens configured in Tailwind
5. Responsive design patterns implemented for mobile-first approach
6. Accessibility features (ARIA labels, focus management) included
7. Storybook or component documentation for development reference

  - [ ] Set up Storybook for component development and testing
  - [ ] Create stories for all base components with different states
  - [ ] Document component APIs and usage patterns
  - [ ] Add visual regression testing setup for components

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Requires Stories 1.1 completion for Tailwind CSS setup and project structure.

### Design System Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
**Color Palette:**
- Primary: #1e40af (trust elements, committed ideas)
- Secondary: #10b981 (success states, commit confirmations)
- Accent: #f59e0b (draft states, pending actions)
- Error: #ef4444 (destructive actions, deletion)
- Neutral: #6b7280, #f9fafb, #374151 (text, borders, backgrounds)

**Typography Scale:**
- H1: 32px/700/1.2 line-height
- H2: 24px/600/1.3 line-height
- Body: 16px/400/1.6 line-height
- Small: 14px/400/1.5 line-height
- Font Family: Inter (web-safe, highly legible)

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
**Frontend App Component Structure:**
- Quick capture interface components
- Draft management view components
- Idea pool dashboard components
- Search and discovery UI components
- Authentication integration components

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
Component organization:
- `src/components/ui/` - Base UI components (Button, Input, Modal, etc.)
- `src/components/layout/` - Layout components (Header, Navigation, Layout)
- `src/components/ideas/` - Idea-specific components (for future stories)
- `src/components/auth/` - Authentication components (for future stories)

### Responsive Breakpoints
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- Mobile: 320px-767px (phones, small tablets)
- Tablet: 768px-1023px (iPads, Android tablets)
- Desktop: 1024px-1439px (laptops, small desktops)
- Wide: 1440px+ (large monitors, ultrawide)

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]
- **Color contrast**: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Focus indicators**: 2px solid outline with high contrast
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile interactions
- **Keyboard navigation**: Tab order follows visual flow
- **Screen reader support**: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Component tests: `__tests__/components/` with React Testing Library
- Visual tests: Storybook stories for all component states
- Accessibility tests: Automated axe-core integration
- Responsive tests: Test components across breakpoints
