## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Requires Stories 1.1 and 1.2 completion for project structure and database setup.

### Authentication Architecture
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Auth Provider**: Clerk (Latest) for complete authentication solution
- **Features**: Social logins, user management UI, JWT tokens, session management
- **Integration**: Next.js middleware and API routes for authentication

### User Data Synchronization
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
**User Table Structure for Clerk Integration:**
- clerk_id: VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE - Primary identifier from Clerk
- email: VARCHAR(255) - User email from Clerk profile
- name: VARCHAR(255) - Display name from Clerk
- avatar_url: TEXT - Profile image URL from Clerk
- settings: JSONB - User preferences with defaults

### Authentication Components
[Source: architecture/components.md]
Required authentication components:
- `src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx` - Custom sign-in interface
- `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - Custom sign-up interface
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Route protection wrapper
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities and helpers

### API Integration
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- **Webhook Endpoint**: POST /api/webhooks/clerk for user lifecycle events
- **Middleware**: Authentication middleware for protecting API routes
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses for auth failures

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Auth pages: `pages/auth/sign-in/[[...index]].tsx`, `pages/auth/sign-up/[[...index]].tsx`
- Components: `src/components/auth/` directory
- Utilities: `src/lib/auth.ts` for authentication helpers
- Middleware: `src/lib/middleware/authMiddleware.ts`

### Environment Variables
Required Clerk configuration:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk public key for frontend
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk secret key for server-side operations
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` - Custom sign-in page URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` - Custom sign-up page URL

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Authentication tests: `__tests__/auth/` directory
- Component tests: Test sign-in/sign-up forms with mocked Clerk
- Integration tests: Test webhook handlers and user data sync
- E2E tests: Complete authentication flows with real Clerk integration
