# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
Create wireframes and user flow diagrams for the core IdeaStash experience, focusing on the two-stage capture/commit workflow and chronological idea pool browsing. Use this PRD to guide design decisions around minimal interface friction and clear visual distinction between draft and committed states.

## Architect Prompt
Design the technical architecture for IdeaStash using this PRD as foundation. Focus on the React/TypeScript frontend with Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database with full-text search, and Progressive Web App capabilities. Pay special attention to offline functionality, data sync strategies, and search performance optimization for the core user workflows defined in the epics.
