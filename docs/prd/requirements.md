# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system shall provide a quick text entry interface for capturing ideas with minimal friction and no mandatory fields beyond the idea content.

**FR2:** The system shall implement a two-stage process where captured ideas exist in a "draft" state before being intentionally "committed" to permanent storage.

**FR3:** The system shall display committed ideas in a chronological, timestamped "Idea Pool" view showing capture time and commit time separately.

**FR4:** The system shall require explicit confirmation beyond accidental hotkey presses for deleting any committed idea.

**FR5:** The system shall provide full-text search functionality across all committed ideas.

**FR6:** The system shall preserve all committed ideas with immutable timestamps and prevent accidental loss through system safeguards.

**FR7:** The system shall distinguish visually between draft and committed ideas throughout the interface.

**FR8:** The system shall support user authentication and maintain separate idea pools per authenticated user.

**FR9:** The system shall allow users to edit draft ideas but lock committed ideas from modification to maintain historical integrity.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system shall respond to user actions within 200ms for optimal user experience during idea capture.

**NFR3:** The system shall work reliably across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with responsive design.

**NFR4:** The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime to ensure ideas are never lost due to system unavailability.

**NFR5:** The system shall encrypt user data both in transit and at rest to protect intellectual property.

**NFR7:** The system shall follow GDPR compliance patterns in preparation for potential future expansion.
