# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a reliable system that prevents entrepreneurs from losing valuable startup ideas through accidental deletion
- Establish a two-stage capture/commit process that balances quick idea entry with intentional preservation
- Build a timestamped idea repository that allows users to track their creative evolution over time
- Achieve measurable improvement over current tools like Notes apps and Tumblr for idea management
- Launch MVP within 3 months with 1,000+ daily active users within 6 months
- Maintain 70% user retention rate after first week with 90% of ideas being committed (not abandoned in drafts)

## Background Context
IdeaStash addresses the critical gap between quick idea capture and permanent preservation that plagues creative entrepreneurs. Current solutions like basic note apps are too vulnerable to accidental deletion, while platforms like Tumblr weren't designed for intentional idea curation. The app introduces a git-like "commit" concept to idea management, where users can quickly capture thoughts but must intentionally preserve them, creating an impossible-to-lose timestamped idea pool. This approach transforms the chaotic process of managing startup ideas into a reliable system that encourages both rapid capture and thoughtful review.
