# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, minimal interface focused on rapid idea capture with clear visual hierarchy. The experience should feel like "writing in a personal journal" but with the confidence of permanent preservation. Zero learning curve for basic capture, with the commit process being intuitive and satisfying rather than burdensome.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Single-action capture**: One click/tap to start writing an idea
- **Intentional commitment**: Clear, satisfying gesture to commit ideas (not accidental)
- **Chronological browsing**: Timeline-style scrolling through idea history
- **Instant search**: Live filtering as users type search queries

## Core Screens and Views

**Primary Application Screens:**
- **Quick Capture Screen**: Minimal text input with clear draft/commit controls
- **Idea Pool Dashboard**: Chronological feed of committed ideas with timestamps
- **Draft Management View**: Staging area for uncommitted ideas
- **Search Results View**: Filtered idea list with highlighting
- **Settings/Profile Screen**: Basic account and preference management

**Authentication Screens:**
- **Login/Registration Screen**: Secure authentication with email/password
- **Password Reset Screen**: Self-service password recovery flow
- **Email Verification Screen**: Account activation confirmation

**Modal/Dialog Screens:**
- **Commit Confirmation Dialog**: Success feedback after committing ideas
- **Intentional Delete Confirmation**: Multi-step deletion prevention dialog
- **Sync Conflict Resolution Dialog**: Handle offline/online data conflicts

**State & Feedback Screens:**
- **Offline Status Indicator**: Visual indicator of connection status
- **Empty State Screens**: No drafts, no ideas, no search results scenarios
- **Error State Screens**: Network errors, server errors, data loading failures
- **Loading States**: Idea submission, search, sync in progress

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full keyboard navigation support, proper screen reader compatibility, and color contrast meeting WCAG AA standards for professional accessibility.

## Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic with emphasis on trust and permanence. Subtle visual cues that reinforce the "never lose an idea" promise - perhaps using visual metaphors of preservation or archival systems.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Progressive Web App optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with the same core functionality available across all screen sizes.
