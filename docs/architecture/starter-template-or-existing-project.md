# Starter Template or Existing Project
**N/A - Greenfield project**

Based on the PRD technical assumptions, this is a new project without existing templates. However, I recommend considering the **T3 Stack** (Next.js + TypeScript + tRPC + Prisma + NextAuth) as it aligns perfectly with our requirements:
- Vercel deployment ready
- Built-in authentication
- Type-safe APIs
- PostgreSQL support
- Excellent developer experience
