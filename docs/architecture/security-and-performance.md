# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements
**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://clerk.dev; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization, Content Security Policy, HttpOnly cookies
- Secure Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, sensitive data encrypted

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schemas for all API inputs, SQL injection prevention
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP, slower responses after 50 requests
- CORS Policy: `https://ideastash.com, https://*.ideastash.com` origins only

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: HttpOnly cookies with secure flag, SameSite=strict
- Session Management: Clerk-managed with automatic token refresh
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements via Clerk

## Performance Optimization
**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <250KB initial bundle, <100KB route chunks
- Loading Strategy: React.lazy() for route-based code splitting, Suspense boundaries
- Caching Strategy: SWR for API calls, Service Worker for offline assets, CDN for static content

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <200ms for API endpoints, <100ms for cached responses
- Database Optimization: Proper indexing, connection pooling, query optimization
- Caching Strategy: Redis for session data, PostgreSQL query caching, API response caching
